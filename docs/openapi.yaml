        # Introduction
        
        The Catalogue is DXs' (Data Exchange) dataset discovery portal and metadata store. 

        It enables *Providers* of datasources to describe them with DX based annotations

        to make discovery and consumption of data both automatable and semantically describable. 

        For search and discovery, it allows users to search through text and geo-based queries.

        The catalogue is a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) document stored and based on the
        [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) information exchange model. 
        
        
        # Configurations
        
        - **Server**: 
          - In the doc, we display the server url to be https://example-cat.com with the hostname as example-cat.com
          - This could be configured according to the deployment
        - **Base path**:
          - Base path is the path on which API is served, relative to the host
          - It is the initial part of the API
          - Currently, `/iudx/cat/v1` is being used as base path
          - This value could be configured according to the deployment
        - **Request Samples**:
          - The `<tokeValue>` in the header of request sample could be replaced with respective token value that could be obtained from DX Auth Server
          - The `<payload>` in the request sample could be replaced with the payload given adjacent to the request sample
          - The payload contains `<some_item_id>`, `<provider_id>`, `<some_item_name>`, for which the appropriate values could be added 
        
         # API HTTP Responses
        Apart from the response codes specified in each API,

        the API server may respond with certain 4xx and 5xx error codes which are related to common API
        Gateway behaviours.

        The application should address them accordingly.

                        queried at once. The mapping between a property and a value is one-to-one. The only
                        allowed properties to be queried are per the vocabulary schema mentioned in each
                        sub-Class of [IUDXEntity](https://voc.iudx.org.in/IUDXEntity).

                Generic catalogue search query. Searches for entites that meet the

                query criteria. The search enpoint allows one to query a particular property of an

                entity, or by its geo-location annotation, or by a full text-search or a combination of

                all three.

                #### Property Search

                One may combine multiple properties in a search through a logical "&". For each such property

                multiple possible values may be given. The syntax for a property query is -

                `property=[<prop-1>,<prop-2>]&value=[[<prop-1-val-1>,<prop-1-val-2>],[<prop-2-val-1>]]`

                Property search can be applied to only certain properties. These properties defined in the
                DX Schema Vocalbulary for all subClasses of [IUDXEntity](https://voc.iudx.org.in/IUDXEntity)

                These perform exact matches in the case of keywords such as

                `id`, `resourceGroup`, `provider`, `resourceServer`, `type`

                and approximate matches (text based) for all other properties.

                Some common uses are 
                  - tags: `property=[tags]&value=[[aqm,pollution]]`
                  - by type of entity: `property=[type]&value=[[iudx:ResourceGroup]]`. Valid entities are `iudx:Resource`, `iudx:ResourceGroup`, `iudx:Provider`, `iudx:ResourceServer`.
                  - a combination: `property=[tags,type]&value=[[aqm,pollution], [iudx:ResourceGroup]]
                  - resource belonging to a group: `property=[resourceGroup]&value=[[<group-id>]]`

                #### Geo Search

                Geo search accepts geojson based queries. The params and their accepted values are -
                  - geoproperty: Which geoproperty to query. Default is `location`.
                  - georel: Geo-relationship. One of `within`, `disjoint`, `intersects`.
                  - geometry: GeoJson geometries. One of `Point`(point and circle), `Polygon`, `LineString`(for interseaction with points and polygons), `bbox`.
                      - Point: Point and radius query
                          - coordinates: The center point of the circle, for e.g, `[73,13]` (lon and lat)
                          - maxDistance: Radius from the center point in meters, for e.g `100`
                          - georel: `within`
                      - Polygon: Polygon/Multi-Polygon query
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the polygon/s, for e.g, `[[[73,13],[73,12],[73,13]]]`.  Note, (lon and lat) and the first coordinate must be same as last.
                          - georel: `within, intersects, disjoint`
                      - LineString: Multi line string
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the multi-line, for e.g, `[[73,13],[74,15],[75,16]]`. 
                          - georel: `intersects`
                      - bbox: Bounding box
                          - coordinates: `[[top-left],[bottom-right]]`, `[[73,13],[74,12]]`. 
                          - georel: `within`

                #### Text search

                This is a fuzzy full text based search. It searches across all entity types.
                  - q: Text to be queried

                #### Complex search

                A combination of the above is allowed to make searches more  complex.


                #### Limits and filters
                  - Documents returned can be limited by specifying a limit and offset. For e.g, `limit=100&offset=10` gives 100 documents from the 10th search result.
                  - A subset of properties of returned documents can be filtered out. For e.g, `filter=[id]` returns documents with only the `id` property retained in them.
                  - The sum of `offset` and `limit` should `<= 10000`, i.e. if the `offset=100`, then max `limit` should be `9900` and so on.

                The json schema for the different types can be found

                #### Non-updateable fields

                In case update of these fields is required, it is recommended to delete the item

                and re-upload it.

            Catalogue relationship search. This is much like normal search except the query explores
            properties that resides inside a related entity.

            For e.g, for  a Resource entity -> Doc A - {id: some-id, provider: example-provider-id}, and
            Provider entity -> Doc B- {id: example-provider-id, name: some-name},

            this api allows you to make a query saying provider.name=some-name which will return Doc A.

                Given a resource item, say Resource A, one may want to retrieve the resource group item associated
                with it. Similarly, given a resource group item, say RG1, one may want to retrieve all resource
                entities that belong to this resource group. In the above example, the API should return resource
                entities A and B.

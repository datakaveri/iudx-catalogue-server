    # Introduction
    The Catalogue is DXs' (Data Exchange) dataset discovery portal and metadata store. 
    It enables *Providers* of datasources to describe them with DX based annotations
    to make discovery and consumption of data both automatable and semantically describable. 
    For search and discovery, it allows users to search through text and geo-based queries.
    The catalogue is a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) document stored and based on the [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) information exchange model. 

    # Configurations
    - **Server**: 
      - In the doc, we display the server url to be https://example-cat.com with the hostname as example-cat.com
      - This could be configured according to the deployment
    - **Base path**:
      - Base path is the path on which API is served, relative to the host
      - It is the initial part of the API
      - The base path for [DX AAA Server](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-aaa-server) is set to `/auth/v1`
      - Currently, `/iudx/cat/v1` is being used as base path for all the DX Catalogue Server APIs
      - These value could be configured according to the deployment
    - **Request Samples**:
      - The `<token>` in the header of request sample could be replaced with respective token value that could be obtained from DX Auth Server
      - The `<payload>` in the request sample could be replaced with the payload given adjacent to the request sample
      - The payload contains `<some_item_id>`, `<provider_id>`, `<some_item_name>`, for which the appropriate values could be added 
    
    # Pagination
    Catalogue server also offers way to paginate the result for queries. If a query returns large number of records then user can use additional parameters in query parameters to limit numbers of records to be returned.
    
    - <b> Pagination is applicable only for</b>
       - <b>/search</b>
       - <b>/internal/ui/providers</b>
       - <b>/internal/ui/instance</b>
       - <b>/internal/ui/domain</b>
       - <b>/internal/ui/dataset</b>
       
    Additional query parameters to be used:
      - <b>offset</b> : The from parameter defines the offset from the first result you want to fetch,  ( <i>default : 0</i> ,<i>minValue: 0</i>, <i>maxValue: 10000</i> )
      - <b>limit</b> : The size parameter allows you to configure the maximum results to be returned  ( <i>default: 10000</i> ,<i>minValue: 0</i>, <i>maxValue: 10000</i> )

     # API HTTP Responses
    Apart from the response codes specified in each API,
    the API server may respond with certain 4xx and 5xx error codes which are related to common API Gateway behaviours.
    The application should address them accordingly.

        Generic catalogue search query. Searches for entities that meet the
        query criteria. The search endpoint allows one to query a particular property of an
        entity, or by its geo-location annotation, or by a full text-search or a combination of
        all three.
        #### Property Search
        One may combine multiple properties in a search through a logical "&". For each such property
        multiple possible values may be given. The syntax for a property query is -
        `property=[<prop-1>,<prop-2>]&value=[[<prop-1-val-1>,<prop-1-val-2>],[<prop-2-val-1>]]`
        Property search can be applied to only certain properties. These properties defined in the DX Schema Vocalbulary for all subClasses of [IUDXEntity](https://voc.iudx.org.in/IUDXEntity)
        These perform exact matches in the case of keywords such as
        `id`, `resourceGroup`, `provider`, `resourceServer`, `type`
        and approximate matches (text based) for all other properties.
        Some common uses are 
          - tags: `property=[tags]&value=[[aqm,pollution]]`
          - by type of entity: `property=[type]&value=[[iudx:ResourceGroup]]`. Valid entities are `iudx:Resource`, `iudx:ResourceGroup`, `iudx:Provider`, `iudx:ResourceServer`.
          - a combination: `property=[tags,type]&value=[[aqm,pollution], [iudx:ResourceGroup]]
          - resource belonging to a group: `property=[resourceGroup]&value=[[<group-id>]]`

        #### Geo Search
        Geo search accepts geojson based queries. The params and their accepted values are -
          - geoproperty: Which geoproperty to query. Default is `location`.
          - georel: Geo-relationship. One of `within`, `disjoint`, `intersects`.
          - geometry: GeoJson geometries. One of `Point`(point and circle), `Polygon`, `LineString`(for interseaction with points and polygons), `bbox`.
              - Point: Point and radius query
                  - coordinates: The center point of the circle, for e.g, `[73,13]` (lon and lat)
                  - maxDistance: Radius from the center point in meters, for e.g `100`
                  - georel: `within`
              - Polygon: Polygon/Multi-Polygon query
                  - coordinates: Coordinates of the polygon/s, for e.g, `[[[73,13],[73,12],[73,13]]]`.  Note, (lon and lat) and the first coordinate must be same as last.
                  - georel: `within, intersects, disjoint`
              - LineString: Multi line string
                  - coordinates: Coordinates of the multi-line, for e.g, `[[73,13],[74,15],[75,16]]`. 
                  - georel: `intersects`
              - bbox: Bounding box
                  - coordinates: `[[top-left],[bottom-right]]`, `[[73,13],[74,12]]`. 
                  - georel: `within`

        #### Text search
        This is a fuzzy full text based search. It searches across all entity types.
          - q: Text to be queried

        #### Complex search
        A combination of the above is allowed to make searches more  complex.

        #### Limits and filters
          - Documents returned can be limited by specifying a limit and offset. For e.g, `limit=100&offset=10` gives 100 documents from the 10th search result.
          - A subset of properties of returned documents can be filtered out. For e.g, `filter=[id]` returns documents with only the `id` property retained in them.
          - The sum of `offset` and `limit` should `<= 10000`, i.e. if the `offset=100`, then max `limit` should be `9900` and so on.

        This API allows one to retrieve documents which are connected by certain relationship attribute in an entity. It allows one to fetch an entity/entities that are immediate neighbor(s) of the input entity.
        To explain this API better we provide an illustrative catalogue graph connecting different catalogue entities below:

        Given a resource item, say Resource A, one may want to retrieve the resource group item associated with it. Similarly, given a resource group item, say RG1, one may want to retrieve all resource entities that belong to this resource group.
        The following table shows applicable queries for different entities.

        #### Limits and filters
          - Documents returned can be limited by specifying a limit and offset. For e.g, `limit=100&offset=10` gives 100 documents from the 10th search result.
          - A subset of properties of returned documents can be filtered out. For e.g, `filter=[id]` returns documents with only the `id` property retained in them.
          - The sum of `offset` and `limit` should `<= 10000`, i.e. if the `offset=100`, then max `limit` should be `9900` and so on.

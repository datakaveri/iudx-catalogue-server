        The Catalogue is IUDX's dataset discovery portal and metadata store. 

        It enables *Providers* of datasources to describe them with IUDX based annotations

        to make discovery and consumption of data both automatable and semantically describable. 

        For search and discovery, it allows users to search through text and geo-based queries.

        The catalogue is a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) document stored and based on the
        [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) information exchange model.

                Generic catalogue search query. Searches for entites that meet the
                query criteria. The search enpoint allows one to query a particular property of an
                entity, or by its geo-location annotation, or by a full text-search or a combination of
                all three.
                #### Property Search
                One may combine multiple properties in a search through a logical "&". For each such property
                multiple possible values may be given. The syntax for a property query is -
                `property=[<prop-1>,<prop-2>]&value=[[<prop-1-val-1>,<prop-1-val-2>],[<prop-2-val-1>]]`
                Property search can be applied to any property
                (including nested through `prop.subprop.subsubprop` syntax wherever applicable).
                These perform exact matches in the case of keywords such as
                `id`, `resourceGroup`, `provider`, `resourceServer`, `type`
                and approximate matches (text based) for all other properties.
                Some common uses are 
                  - tags: `property=[tags]&value=[["aqm", "pollution"]]`
                  - by type of entity: `property=[type]&value=[[iudx:ResourceGroup]]`. Valid entities are `iudx:Resource`, `iudx:ResourceGroup`, `iudx:Provider`, `iudx:ResourceServer`.
                  - resource belonging to a group: `property=[resourceGroup]&value=[[<group-id>]]`

                #### Geo Search
                Geo search accepts geojson based queries. The params and their accepted values are -
                  - geoproperty: Which geoproperty to query. Default is `location`.
                  - georel: Geo-relationship. One of `within`, `contains`, `disjoint`, `intersects`.
                  - geometry: GeoJson geometries. One of `Point`(point and circle), `Polygon`, `LineString`(for interseaction with points and polygons), `bbox`.
                      - Point: Point and radius query
                          - coordinates: The center point of the circle, for e.g, `[73,13]` (lon and lat)
                          - maxDistance: Radius from the center point in meters, for e.g `100`
                          - georel: `within`
                      - Polygon: Polygon/Multi-Polygon query
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the polygon/s, for e.g, `[[[73,13],[73,12],[73,13]]]`.  Note, (lon and lat) and the first coordinate must be same as last.
                          - georel: `within`
                      - LineString: Multi line string
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the multi-line, for e.g, `[[73,13],[74,15],[75,16]]`. 
                          - georel: `intersects`
                      - bbox: Bounding box
                          - coordinates: `[[top-left],[bottom-right]]`, `[[73,13],[74,12]]`. 
                          - georel: `within`

                #### Text search
                This is a fuzzy full text based search. It searches across all entity types.
                  - q: Text to be queried

                #### Complex search
                A combination of the above is allowed to make searches more  complex.

                #### Limits and filters
                  - Documents returned can be limited by specifying a limit and offset. For e.g, `limit=100&offset=10` gives 100 documents from the 10th search result.
                  - A subset of properties of returned documents can be filtered out. For e.g, `filter=[id]` returns documents with only the `id` property retained in them.

                One may combine multiple properties in a search through a logical "&". For each such property
                multiple possible values may be given. The syntax for a property query is -
                `property=[<prop-1>,<prop-2>]&value=[[<prop-1-val-1>,<prop-1-val-2>],[<prop-2-val-1>]]`
                Property search can be applied to any property
                (including nested through `prop.subprop.subsubprop` syntax wherever applicable).
                These perform exact matches in the case of keywords such as
                `id`, `resourceGroup`, `provider`, `resourceServer`, `type`
                and approximate matches (text based) for all other properties.
                Some common uses are 
                  - tags: `property=[tags]&value=[["aqm", "pollution"]]`
                  - by type of entity: `property=[type]&value=[[iudx:ResourceGroup]]`. Valid entities are `iudx:Resource`, `iudx:ResourceGroup`, `iudx:Provider`, `iudx:ResourceServer`.
                  - resource belonging to a group: `property=[resourceGroup]&value=[[<group-id>]]`

                #### Geo Search
                Geo search accepts geojson based queries. The params and their accepted values are -
                  - geoproperty: Which geoproperty to query. Default is `location`.
                  - georel: Geo-relationship. One of `within`, `contains`, `disjoint`, `intersects`.
                  - geometry: GeoJson geometries. One of `Point`(point and circle), `Polygon`, `LineString`(for interseaction with points and polygons), `bbox`.
                      - Point: Point and radius query
                          - coordinates: The center point of the circle, for e.g, `[73,13]` (lon and lat)
                          - maxDistance: Radius from the center point in meters, for e.g `100`
                          - georel: `within`
                      - Polygon: Polygon/Multi-Polygon query
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the polygon/s, for e.g, `[[[73,13],[73,12],[73,13]]]`.  Note, (lon and lat) and the first coordinate must be same as last.
                          - georel: `within`
                      - LineString: Multi line string
                          - coordinates: Coordinates of the multi-line, for e.g, `[[73,13],[74,15],[75,16]]`. 
                          - georel: `intersects`
                      - bbox: Bounding box
                          - coordinates: `[[top-left],[bottom-right]]`, `[[73,13],[74,12]]`. 
                          - georel: `within`

                #### Text search
                This is a fuzzy full text based search. It searches across all entity types.
                  - q: Text to be queried

                #### Complex search
                A combination of the above is allowed to make searches more  complex.

                #### Limits and filters
                  - Documents returned can be limited by specifying a limit and offset. For e.g, `limit=100&offset=10` gives 100 documents from the 10th search result.
                  - A subset of properties of returned documents can be filtered out. For e.g, `filter=[id]` returns documents with only the `id` property retained in them.

            Catalogue relationship search. This is much like normal search except the query explores
            properties that resides inside a related entity.

            For e.g, for  a Resource entity -> Doc A - {id: some-id, provider: example-provider-id}, and
            Provider entity -> Doc B- {id: example-provider-id, name: some-name},

            this api allows you to make a query saying provider.name=some-name which will return Doc A.
